# AEDNet: Asynchronous Event Denoising with Spatial-Temporal Correlation among Irregular Data
Source code for [AEDNet paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3503161.3548048) from ACMMM 2022

A novel asynchronous event denoising neural network directly consumes the correlation of the irregular signal in spatiotemporal range without destroying its original structural property.
